              The GNU hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
              allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which
              would otherwise be unavailable to them.
              .
              Seriously, though: this is an example of how to do a Debian package.
              It is the Debian version of the GNU Project's `hello world' program
              (which is itself an example for the GNU Project).
